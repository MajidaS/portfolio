												<h3>PROBLEM:</h3>
												<p>In recent years in America, we’ve seen a large increase in both the amount of people who have chronic disease and the amount of money it costs to treat them. In 2015 Kaiser Permanente (KP) discovered that 1% of all members were responsible for 29% of annual spending. The rapid rate at which chronic disease is growing is causing KP to spend upwards of $98,000 annually per each high-risk patient (patients with multiple chronic diseases).

											<div class="content">
												<h3>SOLUTION:</h3>
												<p>While the overall goal is improved patient satisfaction and well being, the specific financial goal is reduced cost by emphasizing improved health prior to any adverse conditions developing. Overall, KP wants to decrease spending on conditions such as type 2 diabetes.

												<h3>MARKET:</h3>
												<p>The target market is KP’s patient member base (12.4M members), with primary focus on those patients considered to be high-risk or who are at risk of becoming high-risk. High-risk patients are defined as having multiple chronic illnesses.

												<h3>MISSION:</h3>
												<p>The mission is to envision a new, accessible, and fun mobile application that inspires the KP community to make sustainable improvements in their health, well-being and activity levels, educates them on how to make necessary shifts, and fosters better communication channels between patient and doctor.
